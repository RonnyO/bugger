# bugger - The de-debugger

Bugger is a script which breaks web pages in many creative ways. It's good for at least two purposes:

## 1. Demonstrating imaturity
When presenting prototypes to management, they tend to think "This looks smooth and pretty, we're probably about a week away from going live!" - You can repeat the "No it's just a prototype" mantra for ages and they won't get it.

But if things sometimes fall apart - The layout breaks, some clicks are unresponsive, the browser crashes and so on, they'll eventually understand.

## 2. Practical Jokes
Imagine your FED friend returning from a coffee break to find out that some methods behave in weird ways, some conditions and calculations turn wrong, and generally things get very awkward without a reason.
Hours of fun and excitement for the whole office. Except the victim, though >:-D

Let the havoc and mayhem begin! Just insert the debugger script tag somewhere and step back :-)

**Note:** This project is my homorous, wicked way to practice some unusual, creative things with JavaScript. Please do take it as educational and fun.
